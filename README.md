#TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the passenger data, we build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and more.

The project follows a structured workflow from data exploration and preprocessing to model selection, evaluation, and visualization.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers who were on board the Titanic. The dataset includes the following features:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger

Survived: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)

Name: Name of the passenger

Sex: Gender of the passenger

Age: Age of the passenger

SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic

Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic

Ticket: Ticket number

Fare: Passenger fare

Cabin: Cabin number

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

The dataset is available in the train.csv and test.csv files.

Approach

1. Data Exploration
   
Objective: Understand the dataset and identify any potential issues or patterns.

Loading the Dataset: Import the dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure and contents.

Summary Statistics: Generate summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for each feature to get an overview of the data distribution.

Data Visualization: Use various plots to visualize relationships between features and survival:

Histogram Plots: Visualize the distribution of numerical features.

Count Plots: Show the distribution of categorical features and their relationship with survival.

Pair Plots: Visualize the pairwise relationships between features and their impact on survival.

2. Data Preprocessing

Objective: Prepare the data for machine learning models by cleaning and transforming it.

Handling Missing Values: Check for any missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately. For example, using techniques like imputation or removing rows/columns with missing values.

Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing ones to improve model performance, such as combining SibSp and Parch into a FamilySize feature.

Encoding Categorical Variables: Encode the categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding to convert them into numeric values.

Feature Scaling: Standardize the features to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, improving the performance of machine learning algorithms.

3. Model Selection
   
Objective: Train and select the best machine learning model for classification.

Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Model Training: Train several machine learning models, including:

Logistic Regression: A simple and interpretable model for binary classification.

Decision Trees: A versatile algorithm that builds a tree-like model based on feature splits to classify samples.

Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation to find the best model parameters.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models based on several metrics, including:

Accuracy: The overall correctness of the model.

Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among the total positive predictions.

Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions among the total actual positive samples.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.

4. Model Evaluation and Comparison
   
Objective: Compare the performance of different models and select the best one.

Confusion Matrix: Display the confusion matrix to show true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative counts.

Classification Report: Provide a detailed classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

ROC Curve: Plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the model's performance across different threshold values.

AUC Score: Compute the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) score to quantify the model's performance.

5. Final Model and Predictions
   
Objective: Train the final model on the entire training dataset and make predictions on the test dataset.

Final Model Training: Train the selected model on the entire training dataset using the best hyperparameters.

Test Set Predictions: Use the final model to make predictions on the test dataset.

Submission: Prepare the submission file with predicted survival outcomes for the test dataset.

Challenges Faced

Handling Missing Values: Addressing the missing values in critical features like Age and Cabin to ensure the dataset's completeness.

Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features from existing ones, such as FamilySize and Title extraction from passenger names, to improve model performance.

Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning: Finding the best model and tuning hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.

Balancing Model Complexity and Interpretability: Ensuring that the selected model is both accurate and interpretable, especially in a critical application like survival prediction.

Results

Final Model: The final model selected is a Random Forest classifier with the optimal hyperparameters determined through cross-validation. The model achieved an accuracy of 81% on the test set.

Evaluation Metrics

Confusion Matrix: Display the confusion matrix to show true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative counts.

Classification Report: Provide a detailed classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

ROC Curve and AUC Score: Plot the ROC curve and compute the AUC score to evaluate the model's performance.

Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for predicting survival on the Titanic.
